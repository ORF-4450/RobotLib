FRC Team 4450 Robot Control program library classes.

These are the library classes created by the Olympia Robotics Federation (FRC Team 4450).
This library is delivered via jar file for use in our robot control programs.

## How to download

### GradleRIO (Best Method - 2019-alpha version of GradleRIO)

Add the maven repository jitpack.io to your build.gradle file:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```

Then add this library as a dependency in your build.gradle file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    //... The rest of the dependencies
    compile 'com.github.ORF-4450:RobotLib:v[version number]'
}
```

Javadocs, source attachment, and importing the jars will be done automatically after building the project.

### WpiLib Library Manager (Manual & Before 2019)

Download the RobotLib jar files from [here](releases/latest) to your WpiLib user library directory located at:
C:\Users\yourusername\wpilib\user\java\lib.
Restart Eclipse. RobotLib will be integrated into your robot projects. After that, if RobotLib changes, just download the new RobotLib jars to the lib directory and refresh your robot project. To make the doc available
configure project build path item for RobotLib to locate the javadoc in archive RobotLib.jar with path `/` or 
download the javadoc jar and reference it directly.

## How to update

### GradleRIO

Change the tag at the end of the string to the latest version and rebuild the project while connected to the internet.

### WpiLib Library Manager

Follow the same instructions as above for downloading and installing the library, just overwrite the existing RobotLib-local.jar and RobotLib-local-sources.jar

### NOTICE

v2.x is not compatible with 2019 (full release) or later FRC robotics platform. Only use this library for pre-2019 projects that will run on a RoboRIO with a pre-2019 image.
***************************************************************************************************************
Version 2.4

*	Add "round" function to Util class.
*	Add method to get rotational velocity around selected axis to NavX class.
*	Add inches per second as a velocity unit to SRXMagneticEncoder class.

R Corn, January 5, 2019

Version 2.3

*	Modify CameraFeed class to support drawing target rectangles or contours on the outgoing feed. Research 
	and concept development by Abhinav Gundrala.
*	Modify CameraFeed class to support calling programs reading images directly from the camera and writing 
	images directly to the feed, allowing an external loop to drive the feed.
	
A. Gundrala, R Corn, December 7, 2018
	
Version 2.2

*	Add SendableVersion class.
*	Add functions to CameraFeed class to allow manipulation of individual camera settings.
*	CameraFeed exposure & whitebalance now default to auto.

R Corn, October 30,  2018

Version 2.1

*	Modify NavX class to implement Sendable interface so it can be used with Shuffleboard Gyro widget.
*	Modify NavX class to implement PIDSource interface so it can be used to feed PID controllers.
*	Modify SynchronousPID to implement Sendable interface it can be used with Shuffleboard PIDController widget.

R Corn, October 15, 2018

Version 2.0.1

*	Fix backwards compatibility with ant projects.
*	Fix more issues with gradle/travis/jitpack deployment.
*	The file names in the github release (pre-2019) have changed. They have the fixed text -local appended to
	each file name. This is an artifact of the gradle conversion.

R Corn, September 24, 2018

Version 2.0

	values meaning forward direction. (JS Y axis reports negative values when stick pushed forward)
*	Enhance NavX class to report yaw from a target heading to support navigation by heading.
*	Added a number of numeric editing functions to the Util class. Range checking and clamping.
*	Added SynchronousPID class.
