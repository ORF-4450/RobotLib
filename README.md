FRC Team 4450 Robot Control program library classes.

These are the library classes created by the Olympia Robotics Federation (FRC Team 4450).
This library is delivered via jar file for use in our robot control programs.

## How to download

### GradleRIO (2019 full release and later)

Add the file RobotLib.json from this project to the vendordeps directory of your robot project. You can use the
file url from the list above to add to VSCode with the WPILib: Manage Vendor Libraries command. Check the RobotLib version inside that file and set the version you wish to pull from Jitpack. Normally the version in RobotLib.json 
will point to the current release. Recompile while connected to the internet.

Import of Javadocs, source attachment, and jars will be done automatically when building the robot project.

### WARNING ###

This library no longer contains its dependencies. You have to import the dependent libraries in the robot project
consuming this library. As of 3.0 these libraries are needed: Navx, CTRE_Phoenix. You can copy the json files for
these libraries from RobotLib vendordeps folder to your robot project vendordeps folder. Don't forget to do a 
Gradle refresh after changing any vendordeps file. As of 3.4.0 you also need REVColorSensorV3.

### NOTICE

v2.x is not compatible with 2019 (full release) or later FRC robotics platform. Only use this library for pre-2019 projects that will run on a RoboRIO with a pre-2019 image.

### NOTICE TO DEVELOPERS
Read the documentation in build.gradle for the procedure to do development on this
library and then generate a release on Github and Jitpack.

This project originally set up under Eclipse. You can use VSCode with the following notes:
  To compile, from the WPILib drop down command menu use "Run a Command in Gradle" and execute the
  following commands to build and deploy RobotLib locally:
  build -Dlocal=true
  PublishToMavenLocal -Dlocal=true

  Do not let VSCode update the project automatically on a new year. This may damage the highly customized
  build.gradle used by this project. New year updates need to done manually.
***************************************************************************************************************
Version 4.8.0

*	Update in parallel for 2024 WPILib and vendor libraries as noted below.
*	Extensive modifications to swerve code to support REV MaxSwerve modules.
*	Pre-released 1-15-24 before MaxSwerve testing.

R. Corn, November 2023 into January 2024.

Version 4.7.0

*	Update to WPILib 2024-Beta-3 along with beta vendor libraries.
*	Add new required parameter frcYear to RobotLib.json.
*	Update to use Java-17 and Gradle 8.4 from WPILib 2024 directory.
*	This version was not released. Transitioned to MaxSwerve version developed
	as 4.8.0 to be the 2024 release.

R. Corn, November 2023

Version 4.6.0

*	Update to WPILib 2023.4.3 and use the 2023 WPILib JDK directory (JDK-17). 
*	Update Gradle to 7.5.1.

R. Corn, September 4, 2023

Version 4.5.0

*	Modify MonitorPDP class to correctly check port current for REV PDH.
*	Change the MonitorPDP alarms to not reset if the alarm condition clears on its own. This way the alarms 
	will remain visible on the dashboard to be observed after a match. Transient alarms were not being seen
	by the drivers and we did not know they were happening. Will need to call new reset() function to clear
	alarms on enable of robot (see RobotContainer.resetFaults()).
*	Modify SendableVersion to fix problem created by changes to how SendableRegistry works. See the code for
	details. Modify Robot class to follow this change.
*	Update SynchronousPID class to correctly support tuning via LiveWindow.
*	Update SynchronousPID class to optionally automatically track elapsed time between calculate() calls.
*	Change swerve default drive-motor current limit from 80 to 40 amps. 80 way too high and contributed to 
	power issues at Houston.
*	Update GitHub Actions to use Node 16 per Sean Flo.
*	Update SynchrounousPID to more correctly implement Sendable so LiveWindow can be used to tune such controllers.
*	Update CANCoder instances in swerve code to add themselves to LiveWindow under the DriveBase subsystem.
*	Update MonitorPDP low voltage alarm from 11v to 8v. Brown out at 7v. Set max current alarm to 240 amps as
	theoretical max current from a good FRC battery is 250 amps.
	
R. Corn, June 8, 2023

Version 4.4.0

*	Reduce swerve not moving threshold voltage from .25 to .05 in the drive controllers. .25 too high causing
	some problems. 
*	Add code to swerve steering controller to save (burn) SparkMax configuration set in our code to flash memory
	so SM will retain that config if SM power is interrupted.

R. Corn, March 20, 2023

Version 4.3.1

*	Remove unneeded logging from swerve code.
*	Fix bug in SwerveModuleFactory.resetSteerAngleToAbsolute() that was causing random steering failures when
	called from setStartPosition(). Without it working, setStartPosition would fail when used after a reboot.

R. Corn, February 13, 2023

Version 4.3.0

*	Move swerve drive code into this library from Swerve-Demo.

R. Corn, February 1, 2023

Version 4.2.0

*	Update for 2023 WPILib.
*	Add Util.saveProperties method to save the Properties object back to disk.
*	Add user specified package path removal marker to strip package path from method names in the log file.
	This allows logging to be used with any program.

R. Corn, January 11, 2023

Version 4.1.0

*	Added DeadZone wrapper class for use with WPILib Joystick and XboxController X and Y axis get functions
	to provide dead zone and inversion support. This will allow us to more easily use the WPILib classes 
	instead of our own. We had have been using our own classes just for dz and inversion.
*	New WpiJoyStick and XboxController classes. Decided it was cleaner to extend WPILib Joystick and XboxController 
	classes to add functions to set and apply dead zone and inversion and any other customization we might want to 
	add, without all the code for our original interrupt based joystick handler. Will retain DeadZone class.
	
R. Corn, November 22, 2022

Version 4.0.0

*	Updated the logging system to queue log records in memory and write them to disk on a separate thread.
*	Updated the logging system to include output to the RoboRio console.
*	Added absolute position support to SRX/FX encoder classes.
*	Added new wrapper class CANCoder to support the CTRE CANCoder encoder.
*	Fixed problems with encoder sim support when rerunning auto programs without code reboot.
*	Add Sendable support to all appropriate classes.
*	Remove use of our wrapper for WPILib Sendable.
*	Clean up how the singleton classes are implemented adding the INSTANCE reference variable.
*	Add ColorUtil class.
*	Finally got the Lidar sensor hooked up and tested the wrapper class. It is working.
*	Added the RollingAverage utility class.
*	Added the FunctionTracer class to help find long running functions that trigger the WPILib watchdog.
*	Re-tested solenoid slide time used in ValveDA and determined 20ms is enough, down from 50.

R. Corn, June 23, 2022

Version 3.13.0

*	Built-in sim support in SRXMagneticEncoderRelative now working. Dropped our home brew sim support
	based on dummy encoders.
	
R. Corn, April 8, 2022

Version 3.12.0

*	Built-in sim support in NavX now working. Dropped our home brew sim support based on dummy gyros.
*	Fixed issue with NavX sim support not working when start heading not zero.

R. Corn, April 2, 2022

Version 3.11.0

*	Fix design error in NavX class sim support. Sim was not tracking non-zero starting heading. Still working the
	problem with rerunning auto without code download. Sim support works after download but not correctly on rerun.

R. Corn, February 25, 2022

Version 3.10.0

*	Updated for 2022 WPILib:
	Update Gradle to 7.1.1.
	Update build.gradle for 2022 following VSCode project build.gradle.
	Update to 2022 REVLib.

R. Corn, January 22, 2022

Version 3.9.0

*	Added support for built-in simulation in SRXMagneticEncoder and NavX. This was hoped to replace our more
	complex solution using dummy encoders and analog gyro. However, the built-in support for both did not
	work reliably. Could not determine if caused by our code or theirs, but it appear theirs. Will continue
	with our original solution for simulation on these devices via our wrapper classes. Will keep the changes
	for built-in sim support and revisit in the future. Need to stop now and prepare for 2022 WPILib changes.
	
R. Corn, October 20, 2021

Version 3.8.2

*	Due to problems with Travis-ci, replaced the travis deployment steps with github Actions.

	autonomous programs. Primarily in NavX and Talon encoder classes.
*	Modify to better support motion profiling and path following.

R. Corn, May 8 2021

Version 3.6.1

*	Fix locking design error in CameraFeed class.
*	Add build.gradle option to fix problem with Javadoc search function when generated by SDK-11.
*	Add build.gradle option to generate Javadoc with frames (will be dropped by Java in the future).
*	Add global gradle.properties option to fix gradle refresh failure: must run under SDK-11.
*	Update launch configurations to point to 2020 FRC SDK and libraries.
*	Minor tweaks and documentation updates.
*	Clean up and better document the procedure to develop and release this library.

R. Corn, November 27 2020

Version 3.6.0

*	Remove all Wpilib deprecation warnings. Almost all warnings related to PIDController class:
	Copied deprecated PID* classes from Wpilib to this library so we can keep using them if we wish.
*	Converted all imports from Wpilib PID* to this library so deprecation warnings go away.
*	Copied Wpilib Sendable class to wrap new SendableRegistry class in a more sensible way and
	get rid of deprecation warnings.
*	Converted our classes that implement Sendable to use our new Sendable.

R. Corn, March 30 2020

Version 3.5.0

*	Modify JoyStick, LaunchPad and GamePad classes to correct design error and allow these objects to be
	created in the Devices class.
*	Implement internal event monitoring scheme in NavX class that runs on a notifier and supports adding
	automated monitoring functions to NavX that interact with robot code by raising an event. Robot code
	turns event monitoring on/off and sets the time interval of the monitoring notifier.
*	Implement a collision detection function in NavX using the above event monitoring capability. Notifies robot
	code of a collision via an event. Robot code sets the collision threshold in g.
*	Fix locking design error in CameraFeed class introduced in v2.3.	

R. Corn, June 12, 2019

Version 3.1.1

*	Fix typo in 3.1.0.

R. Corn, March 13, 2019

Version 3.1.0

*	Fix problems in LaunchPad class button enumeration. The constructor that adds all buttons automatically did
	not work correctly due to misunderstanding how the Java enum class works. BUTTON_BLUE(2) and BUTTON_TWO(2) are
	NOT the same thing and are not interchangeable even though they have the same integer value. These are two
	different objects and apparently the case statement compares object ids not the integer value...
*	Add squaredInput() function to Util class.
*	ValveDA and SA now trace the pcm and port the valve is attached to.

R Corn, March 13, 2019

Version 3.0.5

*	Fix errors in LaunchPad constructor that adds all available buttons to event handling.

R Corn, February 26, 2019

Version 3.0.4

*	Minor improvements to ValveSA and DA classes. They now track open/closed state.
*	Fix SRXMagenticEncoderRelative class. The reset(timeout) function was not correct
	due to how the CTRE API handles Talon updates.
*	Modified the tracing function so that when 99 log files are reached, the trace setup function
	will delete the 99th file instead of throwing an exception. The rest of the files are moved
	down so 98 becomes 99, 97 becomes 98 and so on. The most recent file is number 0.

R Corn, January 31, 2019
	
Version 3.0.3

*	Correct Navx class getHeadingR() method documentation, streamline algorithm.
*	Add some editing to make sure appropriate PIDRateType is passed to methods that use it.
*	Add timeout to SRXMagneticEncoder.reset() method to optionally have the method wait for the reset to complete.

R Corn, January 21, 2019

Version 3.0.2 skipped due to Travis failure.

Version 3.0.1

*	Fix bug in Util.round function, was returning float instead of double.
*	In Util.SendableVersion, log ignored exception if the init function fails.

Version 2.3

*	Modify CameraFeed class to support drawing target rectangles or contours on the outgoing feed. Research 
	and concept development by Abhinav Gundrala.
*	Modify CameraFeed class to support calling programs reading images directly from the camera and writing 
	images directly to the feed, allowing an external loop to drive the feed.
	
A. Gundrala, R Corn, December 7, 2018
	
Version 2.2

*	Add SendableVersion class.
*	Add functions to CameraFeed class to allow manipulation of individual camera settings.
*	CameraFeed exposure & whitebalance now default to auto.

R Corn, October 30,  2018

Version 2.1

*	Modify NavX class to implement Sendable interface so it can be used with Shuffleboard Gyro widget.
*	Modify NavX class to implement PIDSource interface so it can be used to feed PID controllers.
*	Modify SynchronousPID to implement Sendable interface it can be used with Shuffleboard PIDController widget.

R Corn, October 15, 2018

Version 2.0.1

*	Fix backwards compatibility with ant projects.
*	Fix more issues with gradle/travis/jitpack deployment.
*	The file names in the github release (pre-2019) have changed. They have the fixed text -local appended to
