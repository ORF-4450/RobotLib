	 * When you start a new version of the library, you can change the version here
	 * so that it is reflected by the robot programs that use the library. After a
	 * library compile, you go to the robot program project's external references and do a
	 * refresh to pull in the changes. You can push to github along the way to save
	 * your work. You can also change src/main/resources/overview.html and gradle.properties
	 * now or just before release. You can push as needed as you work.
	 * 
	 * Note: The gradle process stores the compiled library in the local gradle
	 * cache. The Robot program projects on this PC use a RobotLib.json file that
	 * specifies local as the desired version number so the library artifacts are
	 * pulled from the local cache. However, a side effect of this scheme is that
	 * since the version, "local", never changes, you have to refresh the programs
	 * external references to have the updated local version pulled into the project.
	 * With VSCode, you may have to restart VSC to get it to load the updated library.
	 * Robot projects on other PCs use a RobotLib.json with an actual version number
	 * to pull that version from the online artifact library Jitpack.io where our
	 * releases are stored.
	 * 
	 * When you are ready to release, see build.gradle for instructions on making the release.
	 * 
	 * Robot program projects on other computers can then download or update their RobotLib.json 
	 * with the new version number. On the next compile gradle will pull down the new library 
	 * release from Jitpack.
	 * 
	 * Note: The Javadoc output is not pushed to GitHub. Javadoc will be generated as an artifact 
	 * of the Jitpack compile when requested and will be automatically made available via JitPack
